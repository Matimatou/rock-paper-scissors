# Rock-paper-scissors game

Simple rock paper scissors game on a web page for an odin project.

## TODO
- Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
- Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
- Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
- You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmer’s life.
